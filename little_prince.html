<p id = "p1">As the little prince dropped off to sleep,
    I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. <span class ="u1">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. </span> <span id="hl1">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
    <span class="p2">"What I see here is nothing but a shell.
        What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</span> As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile,
    I said to myself, again:
    <span class="p2">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here,
        is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp,
        even when he is asleep . . ." </span>
    And I felt him to be more fragile still. <span class="u1">I felt the need of protecting him,
        as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .</span></p>
